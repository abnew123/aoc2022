Repo for advent of code 2022 problems. 

To run, go into class MasterSolver.java

Inputs:
* runTimer - if true, will run the timer method to gather information on execution times
* totalTimer - if true, timer will return just the total execution time. Otherwise, will return every day's execution time
* exclusionTimer - if true, will skip days where answer cannot be displayed simply. if false, will run all days regardless (not recommended)
* int[] days  - determines which days to solve
* boolean[] parts - determines which parts to solve

To see a given day's solution, go to DayX.java, where X is the day in question.
